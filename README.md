# Potato-Disease-Classification
This Project helps us to classify the disease of potato plant from image of leaf of plant.

There are two most common disease that a potato plant can get they are Late Blight and Early Blight. In this project we are making a deep learning model that will help us to predict that whether a plant is having any disease or it is an Healthy Plant from the image of the leaf. 

For this project I have taken the data from kaggle. It contains images of the leaves having three Labels Late Blight, Early Blight and Healthy.

In this project I have made an deep learning model to predict whether the plant is healthy or it is having any disease also we have made an API using FastAPI.
